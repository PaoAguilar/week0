            Usually it takes me about a week to show you a preview of your
            illustration and a couple more days to send you the final file.

            You Can add as many characters in your illustration as you want, but
            if you miscalculated and are missing one or more, this option is for
            you.

            All our Portraits and illustrations have a cute colored background
            that fit the mood, but if you want a detailed background or want to
            recreate a special location, we can make it happen.
